                <p class="p2"><strong>EMPLOYEE</strong><br><br>A motivated employee is likely to possess other qualities that make them the perfect employee. 
                    They will want to advance within the company so they will want to stand out. 
                    This means that are much more likely to communicate which is a key trait. 
                    They likely will be a good listener who will take direction and wants to learn. 
                    They are more likely to think about the consequences of their actions.
                    It's easy to find someone skilled, smart, talented and has a good resume, but a good 
                    attitude is gold. It's not easily found, and cannot be taught. For me, the perfect 
                    employee is someone who is really smart, but is also humble. They still follow rules, 
                    accept mistakes and respect others.

                    Choosing a good car is easier than ever, but choosing the best car keeps getting trickier.
                     That’s why several times a year we round up category standouts and staff favorites and bring
                      them together in lists that help make car shopping easier.
                      Not all cars are created equal, and we have the data to prove it. Of course, numbers can tell
                    a variety of tales and we understand every consumer has different priorities. To that end, 
                    we have compiled a series of best and worst car lists to highlight performance in a wide
